So achieving herd immunity would imply to infect at least 60% of the population, which would lead, with the current mortality rates, to 1-5% of the population dying, which is, obviously, a catastrophic unwanted situation.

      "In late December 2019, several cases of an unknown pneumonia were identified in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China [23] . Some doctors of Wuhan conjectured that it could be severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases [24] . Many of the found cases had visited or were related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of these cases of pneumonia detected in Wuhan City and, up to 3 January 2020, a total of 44 patients with this unknown pneumonia were reported to WHO [30] . In the beginning of January 2020 Chinese officials ruled out the hypothesis that the cases were of SARS [17] , and a few days later the cause was identified to be a new coronavirus that was named SARS-CoV-2. The name given to the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is COVID-19.\n",
      "______________________________________________\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The first death due to COVID-19 was reported on 9 January and it was a 61-year-old man in Wuhan [39] . After mid January infected cases were reported in Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, and other provinces in China [23] . On 22 January the Chinese authorities announced the quarantine of greater Wuhan. From that time on the virus rapidly spread in many Asiatic countries, reached Europe and the United States. On 28 February, with more than 80.000 confirmed cases and nearly 3.000 deaths globally, WHO increased the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at the global level [26] . On 9 March 2020, with nearly 400 deaths, Italian government ordered the total lock-down of the national territory [27] . And a few days later, on March 11, WHO declared that COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic [28] .\n",
      "______________________________________________\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "In March 2020 several nations across the five continents closed their borders, declared forced isolation for the whole population except for essential workers and/or imposed strict measures of social distancing. Detailed information on the actions taken by each country can be found in the report [14] . At that time WHO recommended, apart from social distancing measures, that it was essential to test intensively [32] . The indications were to test every suspected case, to isolate till recovery any positive individual, and to track and test all contacts in the past two days of new confirmed cases.\n",
      "______________________________________________\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Most of the cases result in mild or no symptoms, but some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure. At this moment, it is estimate that 1 out of 5 cases needs hospitalization [31] . It is yet difficult to estimate the mortality of this virus. Mortality depends on one side on early detection and appropriate treatment, but the rate itself can only be calculated if the real number of infected people is known. There is enough evidence to assure that a significant portion of the infections is asymptomatic [19, 22, 25] , which makes it difficult to detect them and thus to calculate the effective mortality of COVID-19. WHO, by March 2020, estimated a death rate of 3,4% worldwide [33] . But in some countries, as Italy, France, Spain and UK, the rate between deaths and confirmed cases up to May 2020 is higher than 10% [46] .\n",
      "______________________________________________\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "In this article we propose a compartmental model for the dynamics of COVID-19. We take into account the presence of asymptomatic infections, and also the main policies that have been adopted by several countries in the past months to fight this disease, these being: isolation, quarantine and testing. We model isolation by separating the population in two groups: one composed by keyworkers that keep working during the pandemic and having a usual contact rate, and the other group consisting of people that are enforced/recommended to stay at home. Certainly, in the group of people that maintain a high contact rate one can also include people that do not respect social distancing restrictions, that has lately shown to be significant in some countries. We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. Testing is supposed to be applied to all symptomatic cases, and to a portion of the population selected using some of the criteria adopted by health organizations (see e.g. [9, 11] ). The idea to analyze the quantitative effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as isolation and social distancing, on the evolution of the epidemic was inspired by the work [10] . For the proposed model, we obtain an expression for the basic reproduction number R 0 in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control parameters. In this way we can quantify the effects that isolation and testing have on the epidemic. We exhibit a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic situations. We compare, in particular, different levels of isolation and testing. From the expression of R 0 and the simulations, we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented, the more lives can be saved. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Several mathematical models for COVID-19 have appeared recently in the literature. At the time being, the flux of publications is very high, so it is difficult to keep track of everything that is being published. We next mention and describe some of the models more closely related to ours. In [3] they consider a simple model, with infected and reported infected compartments, and they assume that the transmission rate β is a function of a control u, this is β = β(u). They analyze feedback control strategies, where the control depends on the number of reported cases. In [8] they consider mild and severe cases, the latter having a reduced transmission rate since they are assumed to be in isolation. They use a time-dependent control c of reduction of contacts for the whole population, and optimize with respect to this control. An SEIR model with quarantine for suspected and infected cases cases is considered in [37] , and in [21] they take into account unreported cases, asymptomatic individuals and quarantine for identified cases.\n",

In Section 3 we show an expression of the basic reproduction number R 0 in terms of the parameters and we propose an equivalent threshold. Estimation of realistic parameters and numerical simulations are given in Section 4, while Section 5 is devoted to the conclusions and a description of possible continuations of this research. Finally, in the Appendix we include the analytical computations of the expression of R 0 and a sensitivity analysis with respect to the involved parameters.\n",

      "The model description\n",
      "We set up a model to describe the spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 through a susceptible population. Building upon a usual SEIR model, we obtain a more structured one, which is tailored on the current experience of the COVID-19 epidemic, and which also allows to convey the effects of the non-pharmaceutical intervention policies being adopted by several countries to face its outbreak.\n",

      "The model description\n",
      "First of all, we normalize to 1 the total population of N individuals, so that all the compartments (and their sub-compartments) introduced below represent the proportion of individuals of the total population in such compartment. We will assume the population remains constant over time (i.e., we neglect the natural birth and death rates). We start by splitting the population in the compartments listed in Table 1 .\n",

      "Description S susceptible E exposed I infectious A asymptomatic and infectious Q infected in quarantine (including hospitalized) R recovered Table 1: List of aggregated compartments More specifically, the compartment S collects all the individuals that are susceptible to the virus. Once an individual from S gets exposed to the virus, moves to the compartment E. Let us point out that individuals in E, though already exposed to the virus, are not contagious yet. After a given latent time, an individual in E becomes infectious, and thus is allocated to the compartment I. At this stage, after a suitable time, the individual may either remain infectious but asymptomatic (or with mild symptoms), in which case moves to the compartment A, or may show clear symptoms onset, thus being tested and then quarantined either at home or at the hospital, and being assigned to the compartment Q. Finally, individuals in A and Q will eventually be removed from those compartments and will end up either in the compartment R after a recovery time or dead.\n",

      "Compartment\n",
      "We will assume that the fraction of asymptomatic individuals among all infected is given by a certain probability α ∈ (0, 1). It is intuitive that the presence of a relevant portion of asymptomatic infectious individuals plays a major role in the spread of the epidemic, as observed in the current outbreak [22, 25] . Indeed, an asymptomatic individual will maintain a high contact rate, and thus might infect more susceptible individuals with respect to an infectious individual with symptoms that is in quarantine. In our model, we always refer to the effective contact rate β, which is given by the product between the transmissibility ν (i.e., probability of infection given contact between a susceptible and infected individual), and the average rate of contact c between susceptible and infected individuals. In Tables 2 and 3 we list all the parameters of the model and their description.\n",
      "______________________________________________\n",
      "Compartment\n",
      "The model as described so far takes into account several characteristics of the pathogen and its spread in a susceptible population. We now want to add further structural features to the model in order to include the non-pharmaceutical interventions adopted by public policies to contain the epidemic. In particular, we assume the following conditions. i) A part p of the population is in isolation (either voluntarily, or as a result of public safety policies). The remaining 1−p of the population instead gathers all those so-called \"key workers\" (such as physicians and paramedicals, workers in logistics and distribution, food production, security, and others), that must continue with a regular activity, thus maintaining a large contact rate and being exposed to a higher risk of infection. We will generically refer to such 1−p part of population as the active population, as opposed to the population in isolation. In this group we can also include people that simply do not respect social distancing, and thus maintain a high contact rate. A situation like this has been observed in countries were monitoring was not strict and a significant percentage of the population did not respect isolation.\n",
      "______________________________________________\n",
      "Compartment\n",
      "ii) The fraction 1 − p of active population has an effective contact rate β, whereas the p part of population in isolation has a contact rate reduced by a factor r, thus its compound contact rate is rβ. We will therefore refer to such portion of the population as in r-isolation.\n",
      "______________________________________________\n",
      "Compartment\n",
      "iii) A centralized controller (such as the national health system) may intervene on the system by testing a portion of the population to check for the infectious pathogen. We assume the testing kit to be reliable, that is, we neglect the possibility of false positive/negative. As a rule, then, an individual from the compartment S will always test negative, an individual from I or A always positive, while an individual from E will result positive with a probability δ ∈ [0, 1]. In this way, even though the individuals in E are not contagious, we account for the possibility that they might result positive to the test, depending on the stage of development of the pathogen in that specific individual and to the efficacy of the testing kit.\n",
      "______________________________________________\n",
      "Compartment\n",
      "Let us notice that, in general, the effective contact rate β depends on a variety of factors, including the density of population in a given country/region. However, during a pandemic, even the effective contact rate of the individuals not in isolation may be reduced by increased awareness (for example, maintaining the social distancing), or by respecting stricter safety protocols and by availability of proper Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), including face shields, masks, gloves, soap, and so on.\n",
      "______________________________________________\n",
      "Compartment\n",
      "According to the above description, each compartment S, E, I and A is partitioned as follows: S = S f ∪ S r , where S f are susceptible and active, while S r are susceptible and in r-isolation; E = E f ∪ E r , where E f are exposed and active, while E r are exposed and in r-isolation; I = I f ∪ I r , where I f are infectious and active, I r are infectious and in r-isolation; A = A f ∪ A r , where A f are asymptomatic infectious and active, A r are asymptomatic infectious and in r-isolation. The compartment Q collects all the infected individuals who have been tested positive, either after onset of severe symptoms, or because of a sample test among the population, according to the procedure described in iii) of the above list. Let us stress that, among these compartments, only the individuals in Q are aware of being infected, and thus contagious, hence they are either hospitalized or at home, but in both cases they follow strict procedures to reduce their contact rate to 0. Finally, we will use the compartments R for the recovered and immune individuals, and D for the disease-induced deaths. Both these last compartments will be removed from the dynamics and will end up in the counter system (2) . Moreover, we point out that the portion p of the population in r-isolation is predetermined at the initial time of the evolution, reflecting the public policy in place in that specific period of time. Of course, such fraction p may be updated at a later time, accordingly to newer (stricter or looser) public policies.\n",

If we are in an ideal \"trace and test\" situation (see e.g. South Korea [13] ), in which for each confirmed infection, his/her recent contacts are rapidly and efficiently traced and tested, then ρ will be greater and this will have an impact in the basic reproduction number (see Section 3).\n",

      "2. At the current stage, it is still not clear how long the immunity of a recovered individual lasts, with a number of findings tending towards a rather long immunization period [1, 38, 41] . For this reason, in (1) we assume that a recovered individual will remain immune over the time framework considered in the different scenarios. However, the model can easily describe the case of recovered individuals becoming susceptible again, by adding a transfer term from the compartment R to S f and S r , with a coefficient depending on the inverse of the average immunization period. Similarly, the model can include the case of reactivation of the virus in an individual previously declared recovered (and not newly exposed to the virus), by inserting a transfer term from the compartment R into I f and I r , with appropriate coefficients depending on the probability of the reactivation of the virus and on the inverse of the average time of reactivation. However, at the moment there are not strong evidences supporting such possibility [38] .\n",

      "3. A crucial issue while coping with the outbreak of the epidemic, which leads to the so-called urge of flattening the curve, is whether the number of critical cases in need of intensive care (IC) treatment (due to respiratory failure, shock, and multiple organ dysfunction or failure) would saturate the number of available intensive care units (ICUs). This parameter can be estimated directly from model (1), considering for each country the number of available ICUs and the percentage of positive confirmed cases requiring IC treatment. For example, this percentage has been estimated to be about 6% for China [4] , and up to 12% for Italy [12, 35] . As an alternative, it would be possible to insert a further compartment C in model (1) counting the number of the individuals needing ICU treatment, by modifying the equations corresponding to the compartments Q and D as follows:\n",

It is of course possible to consider the case of an evolving total population, by including in the model (1) the natural birth and mortality rate. In particular, newborns of susceptible individuals shall enter the corresponding susceptible compartment, whereas it is not clear whether the offspring of an infectious individual would be infectious, in such case the newborn shall move directly to the compartment I. On the other hand, the natural mortality rate shall act on each compartment of system (1), as well as on R in system (2).\n",

This is coherent with the setting of the scenarios simulated in Section 4.2, where we assume such coefficients to be piecewise constant functions, sharing the same switching times, that represent different phases of restrictions and policies.

We can assume that day 0 is February 15th, then day 31 would be in the middle point of the interval when lockdowns started. Day 80 (May 6th) US had 72,287 confirmed deaths, while in Scenario A 2 gives 91,231, that is larger but not far. Scenario A 2 could be a good approximation of the situation in the US until the beginning of May 2020, and the excess in the computed deaths in comparison to real data suggests that deaths could be underreported by 26%, which is coherent with some recent studies on underreported deaths (see e.g. [47] ). For Scenario A 4 we make a comparison of infections for the two groups: the active one (that continues with the usual contact rate) and the one in r-isolation. By comparing the infections' curves and the cumulative infections, we can give an estimate on the lower chance that people in r-isolation have to get exposed. In this particular scenario, people that are not in isolation have nearly 6 times more chance to be infected. See the graphs in Figure 3 , were we show the curves of infections and cumulative infections for each group, normalized by the proportions 1 − p, p. We measure the outcomes. The parameters and results are given in Table 7 , and graphics in Figure 5 . The parameters that are not specified in Table 7 , are repeated from Table 6 . For these four scenarios we consider the same testing rate ρ among asymptomatic cases.\n",

      "Par. Scenarios B 1 and B 2 show cases in which the restrictions are not strong enough. Indeed, in both cases the basic reproduction number R 0 remains above 1 also after the lockdown intervention (see Table 7 ), and the infection reaches 71.6% and 43.6% of the population, causing the death of 1.89% and 1.15% of the population, respectively, which is a catastrophic outcome. Comparing these four scenarios, we shall deduce that, in order to be effective in containing the outbreak, the lockdown shall address at least 80% of the population reducing their contact rate to about 30% of their usual contacts. Indeed, in the scenario B 3 , the basic reproduction number becomes 0.93 after day 35, meaning that loosening the restrictions of this scenario (while keeping all other parameters unchanged) might turn the R 0 above 1.\n",

It is evident the impact of delaying the beginning of lockdown on the final outcome: the numbers of recovered and deaths in the Scenario C 2 are of the order of 10 3 times those of the Scenario C 1 . As an example, from Table 8 one notice that, at the end of the epidemic, the Scenario C 1 counts 4.2 deaths per million inhabitants, while the Scenario C 2 faces 1020 deaths per million. Moreover, the epidemic in Scenario C 2 lasts about 110 days more than in Scenario C 1 , thus also undergoes worst economic consequences of the lockdown. \n",

It is worth noticing that, in spite of a higher total number of tests carried out in the Scenario D 2 , the strategy adopted in the Scenario D 1 attains a considerably better outcome: indeed, the infections and deaths of Scenario D 2 are of the order of 10 2 w.r.t. the ones in Scenario D 1 , and the only difference was doing efficient testing at the beginning of the epidemic. \n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "On one hand we show that, as expected, each of these interventions has a beneficial impact on flattening the curve of the outbreak. On the other hand, the comparison among different scenarios shows the remarkable efficacy of an early massive testing approach, when the limited number of infected individuals makes easier and more effective the tracing of recent contacts of the individual, as in Scenario D 1 , and of a timely lockdown, although in the presence of few confirmed infected cases, as in Scenario C 1 . In both situations, the timing of the intervention plays a crucial role on the incisiveness of the public safety policy.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "This description makes available a valuable tool to tune the public policies in order to control the outbreak of the epidemic, forcing R 0 below the threshold 1. However, considering the major effects of an enduring lockdown on the economy of the country that applies it, it is desirable to loosen the lockdown measures after the containment of the outbreak. Nevertheless, the decision makers and each individual shall be aware that a value of R 0 only barely greater than 1 would lead to an increase in the number of infected and dead by an order 2 of magnitude, thus provoking the collapse of the relative national health system. This is better explained by the following scenarios: consider a situation with constant testing ρ = 0.05 and no lockdown where, after the first 35 days of outbreak with a high R 0 (≈ 2), the population gains awareness of the risk and manage to reduce its contact rate so as to steer R 0 to either 0.9, 1 or 1.1. Figure 9 illustrates the large deviations among the outcome of these three different situations.\n",
      "______________________________________________\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "In order to allow the population to circulate with no restrictions, it is necessary that herd immunity (see Remark 3.4) is achieved. The value that matters to compute this threshold of immunization is the basic reproduction number under no social distancing, which has been estimated in this article and in many others as being, in general, greater than 2.5. So achieving herd immunity would imply to infect at least 60% of the population, which would lead, with the current mortality rates, to 1-5% of the population dying, which is, obviously, a catastrophic unwanted situation. Hence, reinforcing what was said in the above paragraph, until a vaccine or treatment is not found, it is necessary to maintain the value of R 0 below 1. Otherwise, the curve of infections will always be increasing.\n",

However, the high dimensionality of Df (X) makes it difficult to develop an analytical analysis of its spectrum and its stability properties. We will therefore follow a different approach, deducing the value of R 0 from the result in [40] , which ensures that R 0 is given by the formula R 0 = ρ(F V −1 ), where ρ(A) denotes the spectral radius of the matrix A.

In our case, the matrix Df (X * ) has zero as an eigenvalue of double multiplicity, with associated eigenvectors in the directions of the last two variables, these being S f and S r . It is not hard to see that the results in [40] hold for our system by simply modifying asymptotic stability to stability in the directions of the susceptible compartments, which has no consequence in the meaning of the threshold R 0 . Alternatively, a way to force the system to comply all the technical assumptions from [40] is adding birth and natural mortality to our model, which has no relevant impact in the results we showed (since the natural daily birth/death rates are of the order of 10 −5 , hence negligible w.r.t. the other parameters).\n",

In addition, let us notice that, if ϕ > 1, then both R 0 > 1 and T 0 > 1. Indeed, from the definition of T 0 , since σα ρ+γ 1 ≥ 0, we have that T 0 ≥ ϕ > 1, and thus also R 0 > 1.\n",
