This baseline scenario is provided only for comparison, in order to evaluate the impact of interventions, most of which are already in place in Australia. To re-iterate, we consider timely intervention scenarios applicable to the situation in Australia at the end of March 2020, in which the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossed 2,000 on 24 March 2020, and the growth rate of cumulative incidence C˙ stayed above 20% for nearly two weeks prior to that. We observe that the simulated baseline generates the 20% cumulative incidence increase, in a strong agreement with actual dynamics.; while the total lockdown, that is, complete social distancing at 100%, managed to reduce the incidence and prevalence to zero, after 49 days of the mitigation. However, since the total lockdown is never perfect, we focus on the practically achievable compliance levels: 70%, 80% and 90%, with their duration set to 91 days (13 weeks), shown in Fig. 2 . Importantly, during the time period that the SD level is maintained at 70%, the disease is not controlled, with the numbers of new infected cases (incidence) remaining in hundreds, and the number of active cases (prevalence) remaining in thousands. Thus, 70% compliance is inadequate for reducing the effective reproductive number below 1.0.

Because of the overall low prevalence of COVID-19 in China, we did not find any significant effects of travel restrictions from China that were enacted on February 1 (Data S3). Also, we did not find significant changes to the importation risk following travel restrictions from Iran on March 1, likely because of the relatively small number of passengers arriving from that country (Data S3). Although we did find a dramatic decrease in international importation risk following the restrictions on travel from Europe (March 13), this decrease occurred after our estimates of domestic travel importation risk had already surpassed that of international importation (Figure 2E).
